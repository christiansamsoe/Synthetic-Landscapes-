# Synthetic-Landscapes-
Photogrammetry Workshop Kglakademi 2022
The workshop introduces the tools to construct digital models of objects and places from photographic images taken with a mobile phone. It presents an open-source workflow between selected photogrammetry and 3d modeling programs. In continuation of the technology's use in archeology and various 3D map services, the workshop provides knowledge of new aesthetic working methods and forms of representation. The working methods are used to register, archive, and manipulate the selected objects and places. In addition, the workshop includes knowledge of the handling of 3D mesh surfaces and the construction of new textured materials for rendering. The workshop consists of a short presentation followed by a collective installation of the necessary software. It shows different methods of photographing objects and selected locations on campus for use in shared tutorials. The workshop establishes a concluding drawing set.
